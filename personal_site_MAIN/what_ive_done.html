                        <p>From Fall of 2021 to Spring of 2024, I got the opportunity to work on an animated show titled “The Wingfeather Saga.” My close friend John’s father, Keith Lango (whom himself is a well-established animator/cinematographer), had been working with the author of the book series the show is based upon and fellow like-minded creatives to launch the show for a long time, and in 2021 they had the momentum to start working on it full time. In assembling a crew to make the show, they were looking for some younger people that had technical potential and the ability to learn new things, and John and I expressed our interest. We had to complete a small test project showing we were somewhat competent, and we were soon hired to the position of Technical Layout and Assembly Artist. We used Unreal Engine 4 to work on the show, and our job was basically to look at sketched animatics and recreate them in engine in 3D. We weren’t animators, but we did very basic animation to move things around how they were generally intended to be animated further on down the pipeline. I did a handful of other things as well (rigging, modeling, etc.), but this was our main role. I got to work on the show for 2 seasons, and I learned a ton about Unreal Engine and what goes into making an animated show. This was my first big job, and while I had previous technical knowledge, it taught me about working on a team, which was something I hadn’t really experienced prior. I had the opportunity to attend awesome events and meet lots of cool people, and I am very thankful for the time I was able to spend working on this show.</p>
