      <h3>About Me/Home Page</h3>
      <p>
        My name is Brandon Lindberg. This is my personal website, where you can see who I am, what I’ve done, and what I am planning to do. I grew up in Eastern Washington, and graduated from Cheney High School in 2020. I have been interested in computers from a young age, ever since we got a PS2. I started messing around with making games in middle school. I have been using Unity game engine for a long time, but recently I have started using Unreal Engine 5. I enjoy modeling things in Blender, and I have experience with Python, HTML, CSS, C#, and C++. I also enjoy building computers and messing with them. I am currently attending BYU Idaho with my fiancé.

      <h3>What I've Done</h3>
      <p>
        From Fall of 2021 to Spring of 2024, I got the opportunity to work on an animated show titled “The Wingfeather Saga.” My close friend John’s father, Keith Lango (whom himself is a well-established animator/cinematographer), had been working with the author of the book series the show is based upon and fellow like-minded creatives to launch the show for a long time, and in 2021 they had the momentum to start working on it full time. In assembling a crew to make the show, they were looking for some younger people that had technical potential and the ability to learn new things, and John and I expressed our interest. We had to complete a small test project showing we were somewhat competent, and we were soon hired to the position of Technical Layout and Assembly Artist. We used Unreal Engine 4 to work on the show, and our job was basically to look at sketched animatics and recreate them in engine in 3D. We weren’t animators, but we did very basic animation to move things around how they were generally intended to be animated further on down the pipeline. I did a handful of other things as well (rigging, modeling, etc.), but this was our main role. I got to work on the show for 2 seasons, and I learned a ton about Unreal Engine and what goes into making an animated show. This was my first big job, and while I had previous technical knowledge, it taught me about working on a team, which was something I hadn’t really experienced prior. I had the opportunity to attend awesome events and meet lots of cool people, and I am very thankful for the time I was able to spend working on this show.

      <h3>What I'm Doing</h3>
      <p>
        I am currently attending BYU Idaho, majoring in Computer Science. I am just finishing my first semester and have learned a lot already, and I am excited for my next 3 ½ years here. While I have messed around with programming and game engines for a long time, I have yet to make a full, legitimate game. This is one of my long-time goals; to make a game. I am currently working on a project in Unreal Engine 5 with my friend John. It is too early to show anything, but we are working on it. While I am certain about my degree, I am not yet sure what exactly I would like to do with it. I enjoy many different aspects of working with computers. I am trying to learn as much as I can.
